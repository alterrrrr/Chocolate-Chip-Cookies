Ingredients:
-2 cups all-purpose flour
-1/2 cup cocoa powder
-1 tsp. baking soda
-1 cup softened/room-temperature butter
-1/2 cup white granulated sugar
-1/2 cup packed brown sugar (light brown sugar works, too)
-1 tsp. salt
-2 eggs
-2 tsp. instant coffee granules, mixed in 2 tsp. of water (used in place of 2 tsp. vanilla extract; either of the two would amplify the chocolate taste)
-1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
